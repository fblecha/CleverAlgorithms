This is a repository of the "professional" development (aka learn new stuff) I'm doing via the [Clever Algorithms book](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/index.html).

The directories will be organized as language/algorithm/implementation, eg: python/random_search, erlang/random_search, etc.

I'm not doing ruby here because (a) I already know ruby and (b) the sample algorithms are in ruby too!
