This is a repository of the "professional" development (aka learn new stuff) I'm doing via the <a href="http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/index.html">Clever Algorithms </a> book.

The directories will be laid out as algorithm/implementation, eg: random_search/python, random_search/lisp, etc.

Yay.
